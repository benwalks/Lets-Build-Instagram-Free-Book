#Let's Build Instagram With Ruby on Rails - Free Edition



Hello dear reader!

It's great to have you here.  The above repo is all of the markdown files & images I used for my Let's Build Instagram blog series.



##Why's it here?

Well, the book isn't… perfect.  There are some typos and little errors that are rustling some jimmies.  PR's are more than welcome!



## Who am I?

I'm Ben and I'm a Ruby on Rails & Meteor consultant from beautiful Cairns in Australia.  I have a blog over [here](http://devwalks.com) and am writing a paid version of the above book that is completely written with test-driven development in mind.  It'll also be formatted approximately 300% better.  If that sounds like something you'd love to learn, you can pre-order [here](https://gum.co/jHSeKq).

If you'd like to get me on-board and create your business a beautiful web application, you can reach me at ben@devwalks.com
